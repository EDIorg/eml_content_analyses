# Analyze EML Content

This repository is a collection of code examples to analyzes metadata content in EML files. EML files may be analyzed separately to evaluate FAIR or for a whole group of EML files (e.g., all metadata at a research site or project). 

Other examples included will display the distribution of years of observation, i.e., length of datasets. 

It is also possible to analyze subject categories of datasets and their download frequency.
